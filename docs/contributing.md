#### Contributing Guidelines:
> - Fork the repository (for basecode)
> - If working collaboratively on ONE individual task, make sure to converse with them and add comments to the code to help the flow of understanding
> - Before committing and pushing to main branch, asses the changes with group members before finalizing anything (excludes individual tasks)
> - Create small, specific commits so that we can track our progress and also be able to identify when and where in the code there's an error, if there is any
> - Create a new branch for your commit and do a pull request 
> - Look over code for errors before committing, keep commits concise
> - If code requires a file, add it to the repository
> - If a merge error occurs make sure to go back and restore the original code before doing anything
> - Using pull requests will help make sure no merge conflicts occur
> - When everyone agrees on the changes, merge the branch to the main branch

#### Community Expectations:
> - Pay attention in class (no phones, or PAPER, or other work or games; if violated, Lord Mort will dock points from the seed)
> - Help others if help is asked for
> - Work together as a group; slow down if someone is still learning, work harder if everyone is on track and learning
> - Give others critical feedback but make sure not to insult them (your job is to HELP them not undermine their efforts and kill motivation)
> - Turn in work on time; do not procrastinate, use time provided in class to advantage
> - Make sure you and the people around you are meeting the learning targets (i.e. TPT, CollegeBoard, etc.)
> - Have fun with CS!
